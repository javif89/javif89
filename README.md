## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Javier. Love walruses, code, and music production.

Coding since 2014

Professionally since 2018

Recently decided to get more involved in the open source community. Started daily driving linux and got inspired by the philosophy of free and open source.

## Projects

I work mostly on a [self hosted gitea instance](https://gitgud.foo) between me and some friends.

Highlighted projects are:

- [Waycast](https://gitgud.foo/thegrind/waycast)
